# page-object
Test Automation Lab #5 - Page Object pattern

Task #2 - Page-Object

Rewrite existing test from Task 1 using page-object pattern

Please follow rules:

1. Work with WebElement(s) **ONLY** inside page-object classes
2. Try to use abstract class while implementing page-objects
3. Use TestNG instead JUnit
4. Consider using one of GoF petterns for creating driver instance(s)
5. Tests should be triggered from command line with "mvn clean test" command (Surefire plugin could be used for these purposes http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/inclusion-exclusion.html)
